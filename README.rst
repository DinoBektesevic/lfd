Linear Feature Detector
=======================

|docs|

Linear Feature Detector (LFD) library is a collection of packages that enable
user to detect and analyze linear features on astronomical images. The code was
designed to be run interactively, or at scale on a cluster and specifically
targets SDSS survey data and meteor trails therein.

LFD is a more complete version of LFDS that contains all of the never-published
features of LFDS. Except for the linear feature detection code in the detecttrails
module, most of the LFDS code was recoded from scratch and made compatible with
Python 3 and OpenCv 3.0. You can find the old LFDS code  here_.

.. _here: https://github.com/DinoBektesevic/LFDA

Installation
------------

Install from pip by running

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lfd

or clone it locally and use `requirements.txt` to create an environment from
which you can run lfd

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/DinoBektesevic/lfd.git
    
Import lfd and be on your merry way. One issue can occur when using conda or
miniconda virtual environments where `numpy` can not be found. In that case it
is neccessary to run `conda install numpy` and repeat the pip install for the
lfd to install properly.

Requirements
------------

Major requirements are as follows

* Python 3+
* OpenCV 3+
* NumPy 1.11+
* SciPy 0.19+
* Fitsio 0.9.7+
* SQLAlchemy 1.2.11+
* parts of Erin Sheldon's esutil_ and sdsspy_ utilities are bundled with the
  provided code. Some of the code might have been altered

.. _sdsspy: https://github.com/esheldon/esutil



Running the code
----------------

Read the docs! They contain many examples.


By default lfd is setup to work with SDSS files and directory structure. This
can be altered significantly, although complete departure from SDSS file and
directory structures are not supported out of the box.

Although slightly out of data much of the processing steps are still adequatly
described in::

  Bektesevic & Vinkovic, 2017, MNRAS, 1612.04748, Linear Feature Detection Algorithm for Astronomical Surveys - I. Algorithm description

To start processing use any of the following:

.. code-block:: python

     import lfd
     lfd.setup_detecttrails("~/boss")

     
     foo = lfd.detecttrails.DetectTrails(run=2888)
     foo = lfd.detecttrails.DetectTrails(run=2888, camcol=1)
     foo = lfd.detecttrails.DetectTrails(run=2888, camcol=1, filter='i')
     foo = lfd.detecttrails.DetectTrails(run=2888, camcol=1, filter='i', field=139)
     foo.process()


It is possible to change detection parameters of any step in the processing by

.. code-block:: python

     foo.params_dim
     foo.params_bright["debug"] = True
     foo.params_removestars["filter_caps"]["i"] = 20


Results are outputted to a file provided by the filepath `results`, by default
set to `results.txt`. Results file is a CSV file in which the detected
parameters. Results module provides functionality to parse these CSV files into
a database for which an SQLAlchemy ORM is provided.

.. code-block:: python

     from lfd.results import Event, Frame, Point
     from lfd import results

     # create or connect to a database
     results.connect2db("foo.db")

     # populate it with data either from output of detecttrails
     results.from_file("results.txt")

     # or create mock data to play with
     results.utils.create_test_sample()

     # query on Event or Frame parameters fo a single or a collection of items
     with results.session_scope() as s:
         # returns all Events found on run 2888, but pick only one
         e = s.query(Event).filter(Event.run=2888).first()
         results.utils.deep_expunge(e)

         # get a collection of frames 
         fquery = query.filter(Frame.t.iso > '2009-09-27 10:06:10.430')
         f = fquery.all()
         lfd.results.deep_expunge_all(f, s)

     # create table like output
     results.utils.pprint(f)

     # manipulate them as OO objects and commit the changes back, f.e. move one
     # of the points of the line somewhere else
     e.p1 = Point(10, 10, camcol=5, filter='r')

     # or just move one of P1(x1, y1), P2(x2, y2) line coordinates
     e.y2 = 10

     # see and work with the coordinates values in reference to the origin of
     # the entire CCD array and not just individual CCDs within
     e.p1.x
     e.p1.switchCoordSys()
     e.p1.x

     # equivalent to
     e.cx1 = 100

     # find the points where the line corsses the individual CCD edges again and go there
     e.snap2ccd()

     # persist the changes to the DB
     with results.session_scope() as s:
         s.add(e)
         s.commit()


LFD was designed to be able to handle processing large ammounts of data, in fact
it was used to process the entire SDSS database of images by using the Fermi
cluster at Astronomical Observatory Belgrade in Serbia. To make the creation of
scripts that ran LFD on the cluster easier createjobs module was written. By
default it is oriented towards running on that particular cluster, but it should
be easily adaptable to any Sun Grid cluster out there. 

.. code-block:: python

     jobs = cj.Jobs(500)
     jobs.create()
     There are no runs to create jobs from.
       Creating jobs for all runs in runlist.par file.
  
     Creating:
       765 jobs with 1 runs per job
       Queue:     standard
  	 Wallclock: 24:00:00
  	 Cputime:   48:00:00
  	 Ppn:       3
  	 Path:      /home/user/Desktop/.../jobs

which is of course very flexible

.. code-block:: python

   runs = [125, 99, 2888, 1447]
   cmd = """python3 -c "import detecttrails as dt;
            x = dt.DetectTrails($);
            x.params_bright['debug']=True;
            x.process()"""
   jobs = cj.Jobs(2, runs=runs, camcol=1, filter='i', command=cmd)
   jobs.create()

User will be notified about all important parameters that were set. LFD also
comes with Graphical User Interfaces through which users can create these jobs
via mouseclicks but also visually inspect their results by using the provided
specially designed image browser.

An analysis module is provided as well through which theoretical meteor profiles
can be generated as described in::

  Bektesevic & Vinkovic et. al. 2017 (arxiv: 1707.07223).

.. code-block:: python

     from lfd.analysis import profiles

     point = profiles.PointSource(100)
     seeing = profiles.GausKolmogorov(profiles.SDSSSEEING)
     defocus = profiles.FluxPerAngle(100, *profiles.SDSS)

     a = profiles.convolve(point, seeing, defocus)

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
     fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)
     profiles.plot_profiles(ax, (point, seeing, defocus, a))
     plt.legend()
     plt.show()

All of this is, of course, just a quick overview of all functionalities. There
are many more details describing this and other useful utilities, including
Graphical User Interfaces to common functionality, provided by LFD availible in
the documentation.
