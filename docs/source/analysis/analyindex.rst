Analysis
========

A small subset of detected linear features will belong to trails left by
meteors when flying through the SDSS field of view (FOV), while the remaining
linear features will be spurious detections or satelite.

This module provides tools and any additional functionality required for
analysis, measurement or moddeling linear features made by meteors.

The module also provides code required to repeat and reproduce the plots made
in the paper.
