Setup
=====

Createjobs module depends on run parameter files to solve targeted data id
information. As described in :doc:`../lfd/setup` .par files are found in the
`photo/redux` directory to which the env. var. `PHOTO_REDUX` points. The minimal
setup for this module requires that `PHOTO_REDUX` variable is set. As before,
this can be done in terminal, or by using the provided functionality.
