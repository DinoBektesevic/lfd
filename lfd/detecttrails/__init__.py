"""
This module contains all the basic functionality required to execute the linear
feature detector interactively or in a sequential batch-like processing setup.

The module requires that all the required data exists and is linked to as
described in the :func:`setup section <lfd.setup_detecttrails>`. 

Central construct of this module is the :class:`~lfd.detecttrails.DetectTrails`
class which keeps track of the execution parameters and targeted data.

Broadly speaking the detection is a three step process:

* Removal of all known objects
* Detection of bright linear features
* Detection of dim linear features.

Each step is individually configurable through the `params` dictionaries of the
class.

It is instructive to read the docstring of
:func:`~lfd.detecttrails.process_field` to see the steps algorithm does. For
its implementation or mode details see :mod:`lfd.detecttrails.processfield`
module of the package.
