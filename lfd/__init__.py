""" Linear Feature Detector (LFD) library is a collection of packages that
enable users to detect and analyze linear features on astronomical images. The
code was designed to be run interactively, or at scale on a cluster.

LFD is a more complete version of LFDS that contains all of the never-published
features of LFDS. Except for the linear feature detection code in the
detecttrails module, most of the LFDS code was recoded from scratch and made
compatible with Python 3 and OpenCv 3.0.

While most of the code is flexible enough to be appropriated for use with
various different data sources it's primarily intended to be used to analyize
SDSS images on a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) cluster for the purpose of detecting
meteor streaks. For more details on its application in this area of astronomy
refer to:

Bektesevic & Vinkovic, 2017, MNRAS, 1612.04748, Linear Feature Detection
Algorithm for Astronomical Surveys - I. Algorithm description

Some of the previoulsy unreleased features include GUI interfaces to the PBS
job creation module, a package for colation and analysis of results, a image
browser designed to speed up the verification of results, a package for
calculating and predicting the expected cross section of defocused trails and
other common case plotting and analysis tools are provided.

Dependencies
------------

* Python 3+
* OpenCv 3+
* fitsio 0.9+
* numpy
* SqlAlchemy
* Astropy

Erin Sheldon's SDSS utilities come bundled with the provided code.
